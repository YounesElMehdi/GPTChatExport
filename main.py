20. [2024-06-03]. User has a structured template for documenting personal project ideas called 'Project Notebook Template.'

21. [2024-06-03]. User is creating a desktop application named 'PartNum Extractor' for extracting part numbers from single-page PDF engineering drawings. User uses PyCharm for development and wants to use version control to track progress. User has completed the first version of the 'PartNum Extractor' desktop application, which includes the following features: 1. Upload single-page PDF files. 2. Extract part numbers from the PDF based on a predefined pattern. 3. Display extracted part numbers in a list view. 4. Save the extracted part numbers to a CSV, Excel, or TXT file.

22. [2024-06-03]. User plans to separate the mechanism of the 'PartNum Extractor' application into multiple phases: Phase 1: Upload drawing PDF file. Phase 2: Read PDF file and transfer it to a text file and save it in the log folder. Phase 3: Use a defined pattern on the text file from Phase 2 to extract suspected part numbers and save it in the log folder as a text file. Phase 4: Read all suspected part numbers and compare them with a validated part number CSV file in the data folder. Phase 5: Show results and save button. User intends for Phases 2, 3, and 4 to run in the background.

23. [2024-06-04]. User plans to start their 'PartNum Extractor' project by first learning the basics of Python, with a detailed focus on aspects relevant to the project.

24. [2024-06-04]. User wants to learn Python in detailed steps with some Arabic words for better understanding, with explanations of what each concept is, why it is used, and cases of use.

25. [2024-06-04]. User works at Lear Corporation and is responsible for preparing a machine learning presentation for their company. They are creating a presentation about a machine learning vision system using OpenCV to compare real-time images from a camera with instance images to check similarity based on a defined tolerance. This system is used in a vision test developed by a company called EMDEP to detect straps and labels in harnesses. The system checks if the harness is fixed on the test table, takes an image, and compares it to detect if the strap or label exists, if it is inverted, or if it is excessive in some positions. The vision test uses a high-resolution camera to inspect components like straps, labels, fuses, and relays, with a focus on straps and labels. The test uses OpenCV to compare a snapshot of the wire with a validated instance.

26. [2024-06-04]. User has another test involving a Keyence IV2 vision system, used to detect the presence of straps in the connectors of harnesses. This system detects straps and integrates easily with wire tests for detection. It uses pixel-based detection.

27. [2024-06-04]. User has another test involving the High Voltage system from EMDEP. This test involves testing harness LEDs, where the system sends signals to turn on LEDs one by one. There are 5 LEDs (white, red, green, yellow, blue). Each LED has a fiber optic that transmits the color to a camera connected to the EMDEP AOI Tools Configurator. This application uses OpenCV to transform the color to pixel values and checks if the LED color matches the trained pixel values. The test is concerned with high voltage wire harnesses used in electric cars. It tests continuity, high voltage, and LEDs. The focus is on the LED test, which uses a machine learning vision system. The AOI application uses Emgu.CV to detect the color of LEDs.

28. [2024-06-04]. User has decided to start their 'PartNum Extractor' project by learning the basics of Python, with a detailed focus on relevant aspects. They want to learn Python in detailed steps with explanations of what each concept is, why it is used, and cases of use.
29. [2024-06-05]. User is seeking more powerful algorithms and libraries for extraction and comparison in their 'PartNum Extractor' application.
